Farm App

In this project I am considering that a farm has multiple sheds and each shed has its own milking machine which could be attached to 
two milk tanks. The two milk tanks are for Cow and goat.

A shed has multiple Animals of different types stored as ArrayList of herds

For saving data in text file I have used PrintWriter library referenced from  

// https://www.javatpoint.com/java-printwriter-class


I am considering Animal class as abstract to provide a common, implemented functionality among all the animals.

Also Milkable class is an interface because to provide a behavior to Milkable animals i.e DairyCows and Goats



To clear the terminal to provide good user-interface i have used 

`` System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J");
        System.out.flush();
```
referenced from
it used regrex to clear the scree 
flush();
is to used to flush the buffer output in the terminal

TestApp.java was made before farmApp to check all the classes
